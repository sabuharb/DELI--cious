Future Plans 🌟
I've got some ideas for making DELI--cious even more awesome:

More toppings and sauces: Because variety is the spice of life!
New drink and chip flavors: We could all use more options.
Save favorite orders: Quick access to your most loved combinations.
Thanks for checking out DELI--cious! 🌸 

User Interaction:
Designed a friendly and engaging user experience using emojis and clear prompts, also I need to fix the Prompts and headers.

Future Enhancements
Advanced GUI:
Replace the CLI with a graphical user interface using JavaFX or Swing.

More Options:
Add more topping options, sauces, and drink flavors.
